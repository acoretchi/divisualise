<p><b>Divisualise!</b> is an extensible, interactive divide-and-conquer algorithm visualiser created by <a href="https://armandcoretchi.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 underline">Armand Coretchi</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>The application allows users to play, or step through, the execution of various divide-and-conquer algorithms in any order they wish, presenting a high-level overview of the algorithm's trace alongside animated details of the decisions made at each step. With built-in, zero-cost, memoisation, Divisualise! also allows users to see how dynamic programming techniques affect the performance characteristics and flow of applicable algorithms.</p>
<br>
<p>Exposing a simple, intuitive API, Divisualise! is designed to be easily extensible by teachers and advanced students who wish to create their own visualisations. Define an algorithm and implement its naive recursive implementation - get input handling, presentation, and dynamic programming for free.</p>
<br>
<p>Divisualise! is built with SvelteKit, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The source code is available on <a class="text-blue-400 underline" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/acoretchi/divisualise">GitHub</a> under the GPL-3.0 license. Contributions in the form of algorithm implementations or other improvements are welcome!</p>
